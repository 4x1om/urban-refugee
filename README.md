*This project was created in 24 hours for [BostonHacks 2024](https://www.bostonhacks.org/) held at Boston University from November 2-3, 2024. [See the submission on Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/urban-refuge-6movkt).*

Urban Refuge is dedicated to connecting people with essential local resources like shelters, clinics, and other support services. With our new GIS tool, users can easily locate nearby services using an integrated, interactive map on the Urban Refuge platform. Our GIS-enhanced map pinpoints essential resources, allowing users to click on each location to view critical information, such as service details, contact information, transportation options, addresses, hours of operation, and more.
